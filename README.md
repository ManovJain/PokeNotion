# PokéNotion!

Check out the Notion Page here: https://www.notion.so/manovski/PokeNotion-5720abd089dd4beea8f26514a3676432?pvs=4

This code was originally written by Thomas Frank. Their tutorial video can be found here: https://youtu.be/ec5m6t77eYM

I used this project to learn about the Notion API. I also used the PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co/).

Stay tuned for more projects using the Notion API!
